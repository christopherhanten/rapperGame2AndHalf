Rapper Guessin' Game</br></br>
updates:</br>
I am rethinking how this is going to work.</br>
At first I wanted to have a button to press to play a song snippet.</br>
Now I think that I am just going to start the snippet on page load. I think that will be easier.</br>

DESCRIPTION</br>
Rapper Guessin' Game will be a simple game in which a user will click a button, and a snippet of rapping will play. The user will be given a list of rappers to choose which is being played in the snippet.</br></br>

Guesses will be made via radio buttons. If the user guesses correctly, they will be displayed a next button, else, the snippet will play again until they answer correctly.</br></br>

Upon correct answer, a picture of the rapper will be displayed.</br></br>

At the end of the round, all of the rappers' pictures will be displayed as well as links to their wikipedia pages.</br></br>

I have some stretch goals of:
- have buttons to select different eras of hip hop history. (1979-1989; 1989-1995; 1995-2005, 2005-present)</br>
- I'd also like to have a 'learn your hip hip history' links.</br>
- I'd like to also, if I can and have time, add a clock to keep time.</br></br>
